                    <p>Growing up in a predominantly white farm town, it was challenging to embrace who I am as an Asian American. Although I made friends, I felt like I was never enough and didn’t feel like I fully belong to any community.

                    <p>After an amazing first year, I was thriving and I couldn't have been happier with the new friends and community I’ve become a part of. I started the following summer as a business intern for an Australian startup. And it looked like I was living my best life on social media.

                    <p>Starting my sophomore year, I came back still feeling unsure of who I was. I didn’t realize it then but I was a new person. The memories I capture of Australia inspired me to create @tastewithbrit – a passion project that combined my love for food through photography (currently incorporating wellness).

                    <p>The rest is history. Leveraging my social life to grow my professional network, I was excited to try new things. Hackathons, startup competitions, executive boards, conferences…I fell in love with networking and learning about people. I took a summer to work on myself and completed the Project50 Challenge - 50 days of adopting habits into your daily routine to become the best version of yourself. It was amazing. I found that work, life balance, and felt so aligned with myself.</p>

                    <h1>A new beginning. (A new world.)</h1>
                    <p>Since the first day I moved into my dorm, everything changed. There were millions of people and everywhere I turned people were so kind and friendly. I found happiness in the new connections and exploring every inch of Penn State. Eventually, I discovered the Penn State Filipino Association, a community full of vibrant and uplifting people who helped me appreciate my asian heritage and quickly became my second home.

                    <h1>A summer of firsts.</h1>
                    <p>However, the reality was quite the opposite…getting stranded in an airport for 24 hours, moving to a new country by yourself, first full-time position, not knowing anything…it was terrifying. I struggled to balance between work and fun and self care slipped my mind. Every other night I was on the phone with someone from home, crying, not knowing what was going on. To top it off, I got a phone call during the middle of work informing me of a robbery at my house. But, in the midst of it all, my mentor and boss Jonny became the light at the end of the tunnel. Coming into work everyday and inspiring with an intentional mindset, his impact led to a wave of growth.

                    <p>The intensity of my health was significant enough that made me have a change in careers. Almost to the point that I wanted a break from college. But i had no choice. Literally. Being new to college, I still didn’t know exactly what Human Centered Design and Development was. But I was determined to find a major that I enjoyed. But also wanted to pursue health to take care of myself and others. So what did i do? I did exactly that…tech and health. I customized my major and took a focus in diversity and inclusion in Human Health Development that let me be apart of the best of both worlds.

                    <p>With my experiences and explorations in new careers and human connections. I wanted to give UX Research a try. I completed my REU experience that has shown me the value in slow living and nurturing connections for a lifetime. I feel closer to discovering which career path is meant for me and I truly believe everything that’s meant for me will come my way. </p>
