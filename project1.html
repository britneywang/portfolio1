                <h1>Understanding Users Through Interviews & Affinity Mapping</h1>
                <br>
                <p>We set out to understand the experiences of undergraduate college students selecting their majors across all academic years and career paths. We conducted a semi-structured interview with a focus group of 20+ students, followed by 12 individual interviews where I led 4 of one-on-one sessions. As I organized the data using affinity mapping in Miro, clear patterns emerged, revealing key insights into students' pains and struggles. Here's what we learned.</p>

                    <p>With so many possible career paths, it’s hard to know where to start or which one will truly align with your interests and goals. This uncertainty often leaves students feeling unsure of how to match their interests with a career.                    </p>

                    <p>Many students hesitate when choosing a major because they fear it won't align with their true interests or future goals. This uncertainty creates an illusion that one "wrong" decision could set them off course in their college careers, causing them to delay or avoid the decision.</p>

                    <p>External pressures—like family expectations—often steer students toward majors that don’t truly match their passions, leading to further misalignment between what they want and what they feel they "should" pursue.

                    <p>Originally, under each major, students could explore details like the major description, career paths, campus clubs, networking opportunities, and job prospects. However, during user testing, I observed that the process of clicking in and out of each category was tedious. To improve usability, I consolidated these categories into one section and added a toggle feature, allowing users to easily switch between different pieces of information without navigating away from the page.</p>

                <p>The main takeaway from this project is the importance of being on the same page and having a clear plan before executing. Without this, you risk spending extra time revisiting and refining your work to get it right.</p>

                <b>1. Power of having a vision</b>
                <p>A key lesson I learned was the importance of having a clear vision before diving into design. While prototyping, I focused on simplicity and functionality, but the result lacked visual appeal. This led me to invest more time in redesigning the interface to be both aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly.

                <p>After our brainstorming presentation left the audience confused, we recognized the need for better alignment within the team. We gathered, shared our ideas, and combined the strengths of each concept to create a unified and clearer vision for our prototype.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This is our previous idea, which involves using upperclassmen as mentors to help underclassmen navigate the process.</p>
