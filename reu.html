            <h2>What did I learn over the 10 week research experience?</h2>
            
              <p>Over this past summer,<mark> I worked as an UX researcher at the University of Michigan-Flint for 
                the National Science Foundation REU. </mark>I joined a team of 3 other student researchers and our 
                mentor. We focused on a human centered approach in understanding how consent is exchanged 
                between people with aurally and visually impairments in online to in person dating environments.
                
                <br><br>
                During the course of 10 weeks alongside my team, I applied for the IRB, digested literature 
                reviews, created an 80 question Qualtrics survey flow, and analyzed 50+ responses with reflective
                thematic analysis.

                <p>despite the first week which was seminars and adjusting to the work revolving around research, I was working on the projects for the remaining time. First, i familiarized myself with literature reviews
                <br><br>

                    <br><br>

                Learn thematic analysis and its 6 phases
                Submit & modify IRB
                Plan thematic analysis process (qualtrics → sheets → miro → theming)
                Week 8-9 
                Trial run on first 20 submissions
                Filter quality responses, remove others
                Revise process (qualtrics change)
                Week 10
                Transferred 50 responses over to miro

            <br>
                <p>as I stepped foot into the research world for the first time, I started by familiarizing myself with the format of research papers and to understand existing data in this field and approaches by analyzing 5+ literature reviews related to computer mediated consent and participatory design
                <br><br>

                </div>
                <br><br>
                Through this, we found examples of publishable outputs that could be referenced and various approaches ranging from in person workshops to online surveys. 
            <br><br>
            <h2>Understanding our resources:</h2>
                <p>Summarizing the methods and approaches from the readings into a toolbox, I felt better prepared to choose with my team which approach was best fit for our project when we needed to.

            <br>
                <p>The goal for the second week was to create a plan to recruit at least 20 participants, finalize a process for our study, and submit the IRB. One thing I learned about research is that it’s important to be flexible and act accordingly.

                <br>&mdash; Determining our research platforms to recruit (Prolific) and conduct our study (qualtrics)
                <br>&mdash; Completed the PEERRS Certification for understanding human subjects research and responsible conduct (part of the IRB requirement)
                <br>&mdash; Finalized our method to run a survey — we considered running an in-person workshop or hybrid study but because of the specific criterias, we concluded it might be difficult to meet all the participants in person geographically, financially, comfortability, especially in the short time frame we working in

                <p>well, we didn’t end up getting approval until week seven. Between that time frame of modifying our application, we revised our survey structure and brainstormed to continue making it the way we wanted to.

            Waiting for the responses to come in, I planned our thematic analysis process with the team and ran it through 20 participants to ensure the responses made sense and were of quality. After the first iteration, a few participants seemed confused with the questions so changes were made. I found an answer that didn’t make sense as it didn’t answer the question so they were filtered out from the analysis process. 

            <br><br>
            [insert error or funny quote]

            <br> Having a total of 4 researchers, we split off the work and I ended up analyzing about 15+ responses. With our original goal of 200 responses, we shortened to 50 to fit it in the timeline we were working on. Due to the delay the IRB had and other unseen complications, we didn’t complete the 200 responses but we did successfully run through the RTA process. 

            <br><br> Although the program has ended, we plan to keep working on the project striving for a publication.

                <p>coming into research and genuinely a place far away from home, I was excited to explore and understand what ux research entails. But i had no expectations. </p>
            
            <br> 
            <h2>What did I learn</h2>
                <p>more than what i could ask for, it has been an amazing experience.
                    <br><br> #1 understanding the research world - i didn’t expect the academia to be a whole nother world but it was great to understand the process and lifestyle of what graduate school might look like as I’m considering a path down this
                    <br><br> #2 - Taking initiative – all my life, school and work has mainly been a “hey do this” rather than “what do you want to do” so it was cool to see how open-ended research can be and explored the paths that I’m attracted to. Seeing how each of my teammates were dedicated to the project inspired me to see how a successful team can achieve and look like when everyone contribtues. Especially my mentor who was running the entire program and mentoring for 2 projects, he answered in a timely manner and gave us constructive feedback to be better researchers.
