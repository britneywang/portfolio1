            <br>
                <p>Over this past summer,<mark> I worked as an UX researcher at the University of Michigan-Flint </mark> for 
                the National Science Foundation (NSF) Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU). I joined a team of 3 student researchers
                with Dr. Zytko being our mentor. 
                
                <br><br> During the course of 10 weeks alongside my team, I <mark> applied for the Institutional Review Board (IRB), analyzed 10+ literature 
                reviews, created an 80 question Qualtrics survey flow, and analyzed 50+ responses with reflexive thematic analysis (RTA). </mark> 
                
                <br><br>We designed this study to answer...

                <br><br><b>
                1. How do the visually and aurally impaired exchange consent from online to in person dating environments?
                
                <br><br>2. Are there notable differences in how individuals with these impairments exchange 
                consent compared to those without?</b>

                <p>In the second week, our goal was to recruit at least 20 participants, finalize our study

                     than anticipated and became a major obstacle for our project. </mark>

                    This experience taught me that flexibility is key in research, as we had to adapt to

                     as we had to adjust our timeline and recruitment strategy.
                    But we adapted by continuously modifying the application and refining our

            <mark> 1. Familiarize ourselves with data </mark></b>&mdash; While waiting for the responses, I planned our thematic 
            analysis process with the team and tested it with 20 participantsto ensure clarity and quality. 
            After the first iteration, we noticed some 
            participants were confused by the questions, so we made adjustments. We also filtered out responses
             that didn’t address the questions appropriately.
            
<!--             
            We reviewed readings on thematic analysis,

            <mark> 2. Create a code book in Google Sheets </mark></b>&mdash; Having a total of 4 reserchers, we decided to 
            analyze the data individually so we can form out own interpretations. Our plan was to review each
            piece of data in pairs, with three people examining each response. However, with 50 responses and
            over 80 questions, we found this approach too time-consuming. Instead, we adjusted our method and
